It can be\n *     overwritten with the `tomtom.key()` method globally or per service  with `tomtom.<service_name>.key()` functions.\n *     It is also possible to pass a specific key while working with instances of the services.\n * @param {\"main\"|\"night\"} [options.style=\"main\"] The base map style to be used.\n * @param {\"basic\"|\"hybrid\"|\"labels\"} [options.layer=\"basic\"] The base map's layer to be used.\n * @param {\"Unified\"|\"IN\"} [options.geopolView] Define the geopolitical view for the new map instance.\n * @param {Boolean|Object} [options.traffic] Allows to easily add the\n *     {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomTrafficLayer\"}}{{/crossLink}} and\n *     {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomTrafficIncidentsLayer\"}}{{/crossLink}} layers to the map. A value of this parameter can\n *     be set to an options object as described in the traffic layer documentation.\n *     If traffic layers are added with this option, a mechanism for periodic refresh of the traffic data is provided\n *     (using a proper traffic model id handling). If you pass source parameter set to vector, {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomVectorTrafficIncidentsLayer\"}}{{/crossLink}}\n *     will be added as a source for incident tiles instead of raster one.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.traffic.noRefresh] Disables periodic updates of traffic layers.\n * @param {Number} [options.traffic.refresh=30000] The traffic incidents information changes and needs to be updated\n *     periodically. By default, it is refreshed every 30 seconds. This parameter's value represents the time\n *     in milliseconds between each update interval. The value must be 0 or greater.\n * @param {Boolean|Object} [options.trafficFlow] Allows to add {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomTrafficFlowLayer\"}}{{/crossLink}}\n *     to the map. A value of this parameter can be set to the options object as described in the traffic flow layer\n *     documentation. If you specify source set to vector as one of the parameters it will add\n *    {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomVectorTrafficFlowLayer\"}}{{/crossLink}} instead.\n * @param {Boolean|Object} [options.vectorTrafficFlow] Allows to add {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomVectorTrafficFlowLayer\"}}\n * {{/crossLink}} to the map. A value of this parameter can be set to the options object as described in the traffic\n * flow layer documentation.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.noLabelsOnTop=false] If a traffic or traffic flow layer is overlayed on the map, then by\n *     default, the labels layer is added on top of these layers. It prevents labels from being covered by the traffic\n *     tubes or traffic flow. With this option, it is possible to disable this behaviour.\n * @param {String|String[]} [options.source=\"raster\"] Sets the initial source and determines which tiles types will be\n *     displayed (raster, vector). If an array is given first item is used as a default source and next items are\n *     initialized but not displayed. If MapboxGL JS dependency is not met vector layer will not initialize.\n * @param {String} [options.glyphsUrl] Glyphs are fonts in PBF required to display labels on vector maps. The Url must\n * contain the {fontstack} and {range} tokens. The SDK distributable already contains the glyphs required by the default\n * vector styles - you just need to provide a path to them on your server.\n * Example of a URL format for this property:\n * ```javascript\n * \"http://yourdomain/glyphs/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf\"\n * ```\n * @param {String} [options.basePath = '/sdk'] Base path for sdk. It will be used in relative paths - it is especially\n * important for maps with vector sources. E.g if you set this option to `\"/myPath\"`, default urls for styles will\n * be set to `/myPath/styles/basic_main.json`.\n * This property is used only if you do not provide custom mapping for given url mapping.\n * @param {Object} [options.styleUrlMapping] Overrides the default URLs for vector style files.\n * The default value is as follows:\n * ```javascript\n * {\n *   main: {\n *      basic: '/sdk/styles/basic_main.json',\n *      hybrid: '/sdk/styles/hybrid_main.json',\n *      labels: '/sdk/styles/labels_main.json'\n *   },\n *   night: {\n *      basic: '/sdk/styles/basic_night.json',\n *      hybrid: '/sdk/styles/hybrid_night.json',\n *      labels: '/sdk/styles/labels_night.json'\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * @param {String} [options.spriteUrl] Set the base URL for the sprite image and metadata. The extensions .png, .json\n * and scale factor will be appended at the end of URL automatically. The sprite URL is required to display icons\n * like road shields on vector maps.\n * Example of a URL format for this property:\n * ```javascript\n * \"http://yourdomain/sprite/sprite\"\n * ```\n * @param {Boolean} [options.zoomControl=true] Show a zoom control at the top left corner of the map.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.panControl=false] Enable the pan controls at the top left corner of the map.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.zoomsliderControl=false] Shows a vertical slider to control the zoom level.\n * It is recommended to disable the default zoom control option (`zoomControl=false`) when you use this feature.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.worldCopyJump=true]\n * @param {String} [options.language] Language to be used for map labels.

Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut\n   * fusion if the section is applied to an array and iteratees accept only\n   * one argument. The heuristic for whether a section qualifies for shortcut\n   * fusion is subject to change.\n   *\n   * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is\n   * directly or indirectly included in the build.\n   *\n   * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.\n   *\n   * The wrapper `Array` methods are:\n   * `concat`, `join`, `pop`,

Passing a callback function.\n *  - Use the {{#crossLink \"Promise\"}}{{/crossLink}} returned by the\n *    {{#crossLink \"NearbySearch/go:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} method to handle the response.\n *\n * @example\n * ```js\n * function callbackFn(result) {\n *   console.log(result);\n * };\n *\n * // Using a callback function\n * tomtom.nearbySearch()\n *   .key(<Your API key>) // this is optional if you defined a global key earlier\n *   .center([0,0])\n *   .radius(1000)\n *   .callback(callbackFn)\n *   .go();\n *\n * // Or using a Promise\n * tomtom.nearbySearch()\n *   .key(<Your API key>) // this is optional if you defined a global key earlier\n *   .center([0,0])\n *   .radius(1000)\n *   .go()\n *   .then(callbackFn);\n * ```\n *\n * The SDK provides a {{#crossLink \"Promise\"}}{{/crossLink}} polyfill for browsers (IE<9)\n * without native ECMAScript 6 support.\n *\n * @class NearbySearch\n * @extends Search\n * @uses ExtendedPostalCodesForMixin\n * @uses CenterMixin\n * @uses RadiusMixin\n * @uses CountrySetMixin\n * @uses OffsetMixin\n * @uses ViewMixin\n * @uses BestResultMixin\n * @uses TypeaheadMixin\n * @constructor\n * @module Services\n *\n * @param {Object}   [options] Options to be passed to the nearby search call,\n *     or Array of such options objects to perform batch request.\n * @param {String}   [options.key] An API Key issued from <a href=\"https://developer.tomtom.com\">Developer Portal</a>\n * @param {\"http\"|\"https\"} [options.protocol=\"https\"] Protocol's type\n * @param {Boolean}  [options.unwrapBbox=false] Changes the bounding box coordinates allowing longitudes that\n *  exceeds 180 degrees when is necessary. {{#crossLink \"Search/unwrapBbox:method\"}}More{{/crossLink}}\n * @param {Number}   [options.limit=10] Maximum number of responses that will be returned\n * @param {String} [options.view=\"Unified\"] Geopolitical view\n * @param {String}   [options.language=null] Language to use in the response.\n *  The list with all the available codes can be found\n *  <a href=\"https://developer.tomtom.com/search-api/search-api-documentation/supported-languages\">here</a>.\n * @param {Function} [options.callback] Callback function to use in case of success\n * @param {Function} [options.fail=default] Callback function to use in case of failure\n *\n * @param {Boolean}  [options.bestResult=false] Return only one result, the best match result.\n * @param {Number[]|String|L.LatLng|Object} options.center Location where results should be biased.\n *  This parameter is required to be defined either in the options passed to the constructor or using the\n *  **center()** method.\n * @param {Number}   [options.radius=10000] The search radius in meters using the coordinates given to the **center**\n *  option as origin.\n *  It expects a value between 1 and 50000, if none is set defaults to 10000.\n * @param {Number}   [options.offset=0] Starting offset of the returned results within the full result set\n * @param {String}   [options.countrySet] List of country codes for limit the search request to those specific\n *  political limits\n * @param {Object|Number[]|Object[]|String} [options.boundingBox] DEPRECATED!

It can be\n *     overwritten with the `tomtom.key()` method globally or per service  with `tomtom.<service_name>.key()` functions.\n *     It is also possible to pass a specific key while working with instances of the services.\n * @param {\"main\"|\"night\"} [options.style=\"main\"] The base map style to be used.\n * @param {\"basic\"|\"hybrid\"|\"labels\"} [options.layer=\"basic\"] The base map's layer to be used.\n * @param {\"Unified\"|\"IN\"} [options.geopolView] Define the geopolitical view for the new map instance.\n * @param {Boolean|Object} [options.traffic] Allows to easily add the\n *     {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomTrafficLayer\"}}{{/crossLink}} and\n *     {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomTrafficIncidentsLayer\"}}{{/crossLink}} layers to the map. A value of this parameter can\n *     be set to an options object as described in the traffic layer documentation.\n *     If traffic layers are added with this option, a mechanism for periodic refresh of the traffic data is provided\n *     (using a proper traffic model id handling). If you pass source parameter set to vector, {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomVectorTrafficIncidentsLayer\"}}{{/crossLink}}\n *     will be added as a source for incident tiles instead of raster one.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.traffic.noRefresh] Disables periodic updates of traffic layers.\n * @param {Number} [options.traffic.refresh=30000] The traffic incidents information changes and needs to be updated\n *     periodically. By default, it is refreshed every 30 seconds. This parameter's value represents the time\n *     in milliseconds between each update interval. The value must be 0 or greater.\n * @param {Boolean|Object} [options.trafficFlow] Allows to add {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomTrafficFlowLayer\"}}{{/crossLink}}\n *     to the map. A value of this parameter can be set to the options object as described in the traffic flow layer\n *     documentation. If you specify source set to vector as one of the parameters it will add\n *    {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomVectorTrafficFlowLayer\"}}{{/crossLink}} instead.\n * @param {Boolean|Object} [options.vectorTrafficFlow] Allows to add {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomVectorTrafficFlowLayer\"}}\n * {{/crossLink}} to the map. A value of this parameter can be set to the options object as described in the traffic\n * flow layer documentation.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.noLabelsOnTop=false] If a traffic or traffic flow layer is overlayed on the map, then by\n *     default, the labels layer is added on top of these layers. It prevents labels from being covered by the traffic\n *     tubes or traffic flow. With this option, it is possible to disable this behaviour.\n * @param {String|String[]} [options.source=\"raster\"] Sets the initial source and determines which tiles types will be\n *     displayed (raster, vector). If an array is given first item is used as a default source and next items are\n *     initialized but not displayed. If MapboxGL JS dependency is not met vector layer will not initialize.\n * @param {String} [options.glyphsUrl] Glyphs are fonts in PBF required to display labels on vector maps. The Url must\n * contain the {fontstack} and {range} tokens. The SDK distributable already contains the glyphs required by the default\n * vector styles - you just need to provide a path to them on your server.\n * Example of a URL format for this property:\n * ```javascript\n * \"http://yourdomain/glyphs/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf\"\n * ```\n * @param {String} [options.basePath = '/sdk'] Base path for sdk. It will be used in relative paths - it is especially\n * important for maps with vector sources. E.g if you set this option to `\"/myPath\"`, default urls for styles will\n * be set to `/myPath/styles/basic_main.json`.\n * This property is used only if you do not provide custom mapping for given url mapping.\n * @param {Object} [options.styleUrlMapping] Overrides the default URLs for vector style files.\n * The default value is as follows:\n * ```javascript\n * {\n *   main: {\n *      basic: '/sdk/styles/basic_main.json',\n *      hybrid: '/sdk/styles/hybrid_main.json',\n *      labels: '/sdk/styles/labels_main.json'\n *   },\n *   night: {\n *      basic: '/sdk/styles/basic_night.json',\n *      hybrid: '/sdk/styles/hybrid_night.json',\n *      labels: '/sdk/styles/labels_night.json'\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * @param {String} [options.spriteUrl] Set the base URL for the sprite image and metadata.

This module create getters and setters for every property of the object passed as first argument and also\n * implement the \"go\" method which executed an arbitrary function passing all the property values.\n *\n * To create the getters and setters the first argument of the constructor should be an object with the\n * following accepted properties:\n *\n *  - name: String Custom name of the property. If isn't define the name of the property will be used.\n *  - validator: Function(value) If the value isn't valid this function should throw an Error,\n *      otherwise it should return the value validated\n *  - defaultValue: Function() This function have to return the default value\n *  - converter: Function(value) The returned value of this function will be used\n *\n * This is an example of configurations this module could take:\n * @example\n * ```js\n * var properties = {\n *   city: {\n *     name: 'bestCity',\n *     validator: function (name) {\n *       if (typeof name !== 'string' || name.length === 0) throw new Error('City name is not valid');\n *       return name;\n *     },\n *     converter: function (name) {\n *       return name.toLowerCase();\n *     },\n *     defaultValue: function() {\n *       return 'Lodz';\n *     }\n *   }\n * }\n * var config = require('chain')(properties);\n * config.city(); // prints \"lodz\"\n * config.city('Torun'); // prints \"torun\"\n * config.city(); // prints \"torun\"\n * ```\n *\n * Take notice the converter function is always executed, even for the default value.\n *\n * As second argument a function will be expected and this function will be executed using the \"go\" method\n * returned by this constructor.\n * The additional functions returned by this constructor are: \"go\", \"callback\" and \"fail\".\n *\n * The \"go\" function will execute the function passed as second argument of the constructor which should\n * implement the next signature: goFunction(properties, callback) .\n *\n * Is expected that the \"goFunction\" will call the callback function available in the second argument which is the same\n * function defined in fields.callback or the first argument passed to the \"go\" function.\n *\n * The \"go\" method can receive two callback arguments: \"success\" and \"fail\" which will override the initial callbacks\n * defined during the creation and will be continue to be used in the next execution of the \"go\" function.\n *\n * If a callback is not provided nor in the fields.callback or as first argument of the \"go\" call,\n * then the \"go\" function will return a Promise, otherwise this function will return undefined.\n *\n * @example\n * ```js\n * var properties = {\n *   city: {},\n *   country: {}\n * }\n * var defaults = {city: 'Lima', country: 'Peru'};\n * function sendToBackend(properties, callback) {\n *   // Ajax call sending the properties\n *   // ...\n *   callback(\"OK\");\n * }\n * function onSuccess() {};\n * function onfail() {};\n *\n * var config = require('chain')(properties, sendToBackend, defaults);\n *\n * // Calling \"go\" passing callbacks\n * config.go(onSuccess, onfail);\n *\n * // Calling go and receive a Promise\n * config.go()\n *   .then(onSuccess)\n *   .catch(onFail);\n * ```\n *\n * Do you think this was difficult to read? Believe me, the most difficult was to write it.\n * @private\n * @class Chain\n * @module Services\n * @constructor\n * @param {Object}   fields\n * @param {Function} fields.callback Default callback function to be executed by \"goFunction\" function\n * @param {Function} fields.fail Default fail function callback to be executed by \"goFunction\" function\n * @param {Function} [goFunction] Should have the signature: function(properties, callback): Promise|undefined\n * @param {Object}   [options] Object with the initial values for the properties defined in the \"fields\" argument\n * @param {Function} [options.fail] Failsafe \"fail\" function to be executed by \"goFunction\" callback argument.\n *                                  It will override \"fields.fail\" (yeah, don't ask me why)\n */\n\n/**\n * Executes a predefined asynchronous task using the current configuration and then execute one of\n * the callback functions based on the success of the result.\n *\n * It receives two optional arguments. The first one is a callback function that will be used when\n * the task is successfully completed. The second one is another callback function\n * that will be used only in case of failure.\n *\n * Both arguments are shortcuts for the <b>callback</b> and <b>fail</b> methods respectively.\n *\n * @example\n * All the ways of using this method:\n * ```js\n * // Defining callbacks as function arguments\n * tomtom.fuzzySearch()\n *   .query(\"pizza\")\n *   .go(successCallback, failureCallback);\n *\n * // Defining callbacks using setters methods\n * tomtom.fuzzySearch()\n *   .query(\"pizza\")\n *   .callback(successCallback)\n *   .fail(failureCallback)\n *   .go();\n *\n * // Using the returned Promise\n * tomtom.fuzzySearch()\n *   .query(\"pizza\")\n *   .go()\n *   .then(successCallback)\n *   .catch(failureCallback);\n * ```\n * The SDK provides a Promise polyfill for browsers (IE<9) without native ECMAScript 6 support.\n *\n * @method go\n * @param {Function} [success] The callback function to be called on case of success\n * @param {Function} [fail] The callback function to be called on case of failure.\n *     If a success callback was not given this argument will be ignored.

description.\n *\n * This parameter will be ignored if the callback function is not defined and therefore the\n * <b>go</b> method will return a Promise that will be rejected if an error occurs.\n *\n * If you don't specificy a failure callback, the default behavior in case of encounter a problem is to\n * throw an error.\n *\n * @example\n * ```js\n * function successCallback(results) {\n *

var miniMapControl = new L.TomTomMinimap(miniMapOptions);\n * miniMapControl.addTo(map);\n * ```\n *\n * @example\n * ```javascript\n * var widget = new L.TomTomMinimap({\n *   height: 90,\n *   width: 120,\n *   // zoom difference between the main map and minimaps (defaults to -8)\n *   zoomLevelOffset: -8,\n *\n *   // below options have default values:\n *   toggleDisplay: true,     //
